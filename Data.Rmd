## **Data Sources**
We used [NYC Department of Health Coronavirus Data website](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page) and [GitHub Data Repository](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data):This repository contains information on COVID-19 vaccination and booster reporting across the five boroughs, updated daily, aggregated at modified zipcode tabulation areas.

Details about MODZTA can be found [here](https://nychealth.github.io/covid-maps/modzcta-geo/about.html) and the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/tree/master/Geography-resources).

Along with this we used four datasets from [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov) to construct our analysis of socioeconomic and demographic variables.We used the New York State census data and merged them using the NYC MODZTA.

1. [Total population](https://data.census.gov/table?q=P1&tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P1)

`r tot_pop_df = read_csv(file = "./data/tot_pop.csv")`

2. [Education Attainment](https://data.census.gov/table?q=S1501&tid=ACSST1Y2021.S1501)

3. [Poverty Status in the past 12 months](https://data.census.gov/table?q=S1701)

4. [Median Income in the past 12 months](https://data.census.gov/table?q=S1903)
