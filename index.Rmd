## Motivation

Throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine availability played a significant role in the reduction of new cases, reducing symptom severity and soon became a requirement for returning to work throughout NYC. With the rise of new variants and return to in-person activities, optional boosters became available.

Throughout the pandemic, there were reports of a lack of vaccine availability in many areas of NYC, especially among those of lower socioeconomic status and limited geographic resource availability.

Given these reports, we used citywide data from 90 days after individuals above 18 years of age could receive boosters to explore:

1. General trends in rates of completed FDA approved primary series vaccinations and boosters.

2. How vaccination and booster rates differed across boroughs. 

3. How vaccination and booster rates differed based on neighborhood sociodemographic factors including : Education, Median Income and Poverty Status.
