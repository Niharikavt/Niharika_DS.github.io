# **Project Report for P8105**
#### *By Brittany Shea | Erfan Faridmoayer| Niharika Telrandhe| Pooja Desai | Sabah Usmani*

## **Project Motivation**

Throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine availability played a significant role in the reduction of new cases, reducing symptom severity and soon became a requirement for returning to work throughout NYC. With the rise of new variants and return to in-person activities, optional boosters became available.

Throughout the pandemic, there were reports of a lack of vaccine availability in many areas of NYC, especially among those of lower socioeconomic status and limited geographic resource availability.

Given these reports, we used citywide data from 90 days after individuals above 18 years of age could receive boosters to explore:

1. General trends in rates of completed FDA approved primary series vaccinations and boosters.

2. How vaccination and booster rates differed across boroughs. 

3. How vaccination and booster rates differed based on neighborhood sociodemographic factors including : Education, Median Income and Poverty Status.

### *Related Work*

The following articles motivated this problems and provided the inspiration for this project: [Socioeconomic factors explain why some New York ZIP codes were hit hardest by COVID-19](https://www.savi.org/2020/06/24/socioeconomic-factors-explain-why-some-new-york-zip-codes-were-hit-hardest-by-covid-19/ )
 

The `ggplot function` in R combined with the [New York City COVID-19 geographic mapping](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page) found here was the inspiration for us to further evaluate the trends in vaccine and booster distribution across New York City based on the available zip codes.




## **Initial Questions**
Q1. What socio-demographic and geographic factors make a neighborhood vulnerable with respect to COVID-19 vaccination and boosters.

Q2. How many people were vaccinated - partially, fully and with boosters?

Q3. How education attainment, poverty status, median income was affecting vaccination and booster distribution in NYC.

Q4.Vaccination and booster distribution with respect to zip codes in NYC.

### *Roadblocks & General Difficulties*

</center>

<img src="images/roadblock.jpg">

#### **Roadblock 1.** Zip codes vary! We realized zip codes are not the best or most reliable way to define boundaries and that they were available in a variety of formats. Not all datasets had the MODZTAs available.
#### **Trouble-shooting** We went ahead and used the modified zipcode tabulated areas of MODZTAs and you can find more information about it linked in the data sources below.

#### **Roadblock 2.** We were unable to analyze booster uptake and distributions before 9th March 2022. The NYC COVID data only added a column called `count_additional` which was a count of everyone who received a completed FDA-approved primary series plus additional boosters for people aged 18+ in NYC.The data did not clearly record the initial booster rollouts for priority population before it was approved for all above 18.
#### **Trouble-shooting** We restricted our vaccination and booster data from 9th March 2022 onwards  (approximately 90 days after the booster was approved for 18+) as well as poverty status and median income in the past 12 months only to keep our analysis fresh and updated.

#### **Roadblock 3** We were unable to find complete, reliable data for our demographic variables of interest (education status, median income, poverty status) for the same year as our vaccine data (2022). 
#### **Trouble-shooting** We opted to use census data from 2020 to provide and understanding of popoulation demographics with regards to these variabales. Through there were slight differences in total populations counts, we continued with this data with the assumption that variation would be similarly distributed across all neighborhoods.

### *Evolution of Analytic Questions* 

After cleaning the data our focus shifted from the initial analysis to the following:-

Q1. How does education attainment, poverty status in the past 12 months and median income in the past 12 months affect the vaccine and booster distribution in NYC by MODTZAs and boroughs.

Q2. How many people were vaccinated - partially, fully and with boosters post 9th March 2022 by boroughs and zipcodes?

Q3. The vaccination and booster status of the proportion of individuals aged 18+ who were below the poverty level by boroughs.

Q4. How did the recent booster rollout look in NYC - the big picture.

## **Data** 

### *Data Sources*

#### **1. The vaccination coverage and booster data in NYC**
We used city vaccination and booster data from [NYC Department of Health Coronavirus Data website](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page) and [GitHub Data Repository](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data). This data is updated daily.

#### **2. The Zip Code data for NYC**
MODZCTA (Modified Zipcode Tabulated Areas) is a geography used to analyze health data. The MODZCTA geography combines census blocks with smaller populations to allow more stable estimates of population size for rate calculation.

Details about MODZTA can be found [here](https://nychealth.github.io/covid-maps/modzcta-geo/about.html) and the zip code data was pulled from their [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data/tree/master/Geography-resources).

Along with this we used additional datasets from [US Census Bureau](https://data.census.gov) to construct our analysis of socioeconomic and demographic variables.We filtered and downloaded only New York State Census Data and merged datasets using the NYC MODZTA on the zip code level.

#### **3. The Total Population ** 
[P1: Race for the Total Population (Decennial Census 2020) ](https://data.census.gov/table?q=P1&tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P1)

#### **4. The Education Attainment **
[S1501: Educational Attainment 2020](https://data.census.gov/table?q=S1501&tid=ACSST1Y2021.S1501)

#### **5. The Poverty Status in the past 12 months **
[S1701: Poverty status in the past 12 months (2021)](https://data.census.gov/table?q=S1701)

#### **6. The Median Income in the past 12 months **
[S1903: Median Income in the past 12 months (In 2021 Inflation adjusted dollars)](https://data.census.gov/table?q=S1903)

### **Data Processing and Cleaning**

#### **1. The vaccination coverage and booster data in NYC**
This repository contains information on COVID-19 vaccination and booster data reporting across the five boroughs, updated daily, aggregated at modified zip code tabulation areas (MODZCTAs). Booster data was only available for those aged 18+ from 9th March 2022 onwards.We filtered out all the missing values and kept only the columns that were relevant for our analysis.

After data cleaning, we had the following variables in our dataset:

- `Neighborhood_Name`: Neighborhoods in NYC like Chelsea, Financial District, Chinatown, Lower East Side, NoMad, SoHo, etc.
- `Borough`: Five boroughs - Manhattan, Staten Island, Queens, Brooklyn and Bronx.
- `MODZCTA`:We report information by geography using modified ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (MODZCTA) based on the ZIP code of residence reported by the vaccination recipient at the time of vaccination.
- `Label`:Multiple zipcodes which fell under the same MODZCTA.
- `Pop_Denominator`:The Health Department produced these population estimates using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and incorporating additional data from the NYC Department of City Planning and the Department of Buildings on new housing construction.
- `Count_Partially_Cumulative`:The number of people who have received the first dose of a two-dose primary vaccine series (i.e. Pfizer-BioNtech or Moderna).
- `Count_Fully_Cumulative`: People who have received both doses of the Pfizer, Moderna or AstraZeneca primary vaccine series or the one dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine primary vaccine series.
- `Count_1Plus_Cumulative`:People who have received either the first dose of the two-dose Pfizer or Moderna primary vaccine series or the one dose of the Johnson & Johnson primary vaccine series. New Yorkers who received the AstraZeneca vaccine are only counted if they received both doses of the two-dose vaccine.
- `Count_Additional_Cumulative`:People who have received additional doses of an FDA-approved vaccine after completing their primary series. This includes first and second booster shots, as well as additional doses for people who are immunocompromised.

We further calculated proportions for each vaccination status by dividing the cumulative vaccination status by population denominator.

- `Count_Partially_prop`=Count_Partially_Cumulative/Pop_Denominator
- `Count_Fully_prop`=Count_Fully_Cumulative/Pop_Denominator
- `Count_1Plus_prop`=Count_1Plus_Cumulative/Pop_Denominator
- `Count_Additional_prop`=Count_Additional_Cumulative/Pop_Denominator

#### **2. The Zip Code data for NYC**
This repository contained the MODZCTA and ZCTA for New York.
MODZCTA (Modified Zipcode Tabulated Areas) is a geography used to analyze health data. The MODZCTA geography combines census blocks with smaller populations to allow more stable estimates of population size for rate calculation.

We report information by geography using modified ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (MODZCTA) based on the ZIP code of residence reported by the vaccination recipient at the time of vaccination.

After data cleaning, we had the following variables in out dataset:

- `MODZCTA`
- `Label`
- `ZCTA`
- `pop_est`
- `the_geom`

#### **3. The Total Population ** 

We removed the column that only included null values using the select function. After using `janitor` package to clean the data, the `geo_id` census columns were modified as a string, and mutated into a new `zip code` column.

- `geo_id` : census code for each zipcode
- `population`: total population based on census in zipcode
- `zip_code` : associated population zipcode

#### **4. The Education Attainment **

We removed the null values. After cleaning, this dataset contains the following -

- `count_age_edu`
- `edu_count`
- `edu`
- `age` : Under 65 and Above 65
- `edu_prop`

#### **5. The Poverty Status **

Neighborhood poverty is the estimated proportion of the population 18 years and older below the Federal Poverty Level for whom poverty status is determined by ZIP code, per the 2014-2018 American Community Survey.

After data cleaning we had the following variables:

- `Modzcta` : Modified Zip Code Tabulation Areas
- `Total_pop_pov_det_18_and_over` : Estimate population 18+ for whom poverty status is determined
- `Below_pov_level_pop_pov_det_18_and_over`: Estimate population 18+ below poverty level for whom poverty status is determined
- `Prop_below_pov_level_18_and_over`: Estimate proportion below poverty level for whom poverty status is determined 18+

#### **6. The Median Income **

We removed the null values. After cleaning, this dataset contains the following -

- `median_fam` :median income family
- `median nonfam` :median income non-family

### **Exploratory Analysis**

```{r setup, include = FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
	echo = TRUE,
	warning = FALSE,

  fig.height = 6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))

  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)
scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d

```

#### **General Vaccine Data in NYC**

We began with a preliminary data exploration of the proportion of individuals who  were fully vaccinated and received boosters across different zipcodes in each borough by 3.09.22 (90 days after the booster approval).

```{r, include=FALSE}
merged_vaccine_data = read_csv(file="./data/merged_vaccine_data.csv")
```

#### Fully Vaccinated Individuals by Zipcode and Boroughs:

Fully Vaccinated: The graph below shows the proportion of people fully vaccinated (y-axis) in each zipcode (x-axis). The colors indicate the borough. From this graph we note a few observations:

1. In several neighborhoods the proportion of individuals vaccinated exceeds 1 (the blue line, which represents 100% of the population being completely vaccinated). This indicates that within those neighborhoods individuals received the primary vaccination series more than once.

2. While each borough ranged in the proportion of individuals vaccinated per neighborhood, it appears no neighborhoods in Staten Island and the Bronx had 100% of the population vaccinated. By contrast, in several neighborhoods across Manhattan and Brooklyn, individuals were fully vaccinated more than once.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
fully_plotly =
ggplot(merged_vaccine_data) +
  aes(
    x = modzcta,
    y = count_Fully_prop,
    colour = borough
  ) +
  geom_point(shape = "circle", size = 1) +
  scale_color_hue(direction = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Zip Codes",
    y = "Proportion of Fully Vaccinated Individuals",
    title = "Proportion Fully Vaccinated Individuals in each Zipcode across Boroughs",
    subtitle = "(The horizontal line at 1 indicates 100% have received 2 doses of an FDA-approved Primary Vaccine series)",
    color = "Boroughs"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() + geom_hline(yintercept=1, linetype="solid",  color = "navy", size=0.5)

ggplotly (fully_plotly)
```

#### Additional/Boosted Individuals by Zipcode and Boroughs:

Boosted: The graph below shows the proportion of people fully boosted (y-axis) in each zip code (x-axis) with colors indicating the borough. This data was collected as of 3.09.22, 90 days after the booster was approved for individuals 18+.

From this graph, it is interesting to note that the proportion of individuals who received a vaccine across all boroughs ranged from 0-0.75. As before, neighborhoods in Staten Island and the Bronx had a fewer proportion of individuals who received the booster.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
boosted_plotly=
ggplot(merged_vaccine_data) +
  aes(
    x = modzcta,
    y = count_Additional_prop,
    colour = borough
  ) +
  geom_point(shape = "circle", size = 1) +
  scale_color_hue(direction = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Zip Codes",
    y = "Proportion of Boosted Individuals",
    title = "Proportion of Boosted Individuals in each Zipcode across Boroughs",
    subtitle = "(The horizontal line at 1 indicates 100% have received a booster)",
    color = "Boroughs"
  ) + theme_minimal() + geom_hline(yintercept=1, linetype="solid",  color = "navy", size=0.5)

ggplotly(boosted_plotly)
```

#### We then sought to explore how vaccination and booster trends varied across different demographic characteristics.

#### **1. Education **
First, we used an education dataset from the 2020 US census to understand patterns in educational attainment with full vaccination or booster status. In these graphs each dot represents a zip code region. The proportion of individuals with a particular vaccine status is on the y-axis and plotted against the proportion of individuals with a particular education status per zip code is on the x-axis. 

```{r, include=FALSE}
cleaned_edu_booster_dataset = read_csv(file="./data/cleaned_edu_booster_dataset.csv")
```

#### Fully Vaccinated Individuals by Education Status and Age

Plot 1a below shows the proportion of fully vaccinated individuals by education status (the colors), split across age. We observe that while individuals across education receive full vaccinations, the communities with higher proportions of individuals with above a high school education tend to seek multiple rounds of full vaccinations. 

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(cleaned_edu_booster_dataset) +
  aes(x = edu_prop, y = fully_vaccinated_prop, colour = edu) +
  geom_point(shape = "circle", size = 1) +
  scale_color_hue(direction = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Proportion of Individuals by Education Status",
    y = "Proportion of Fully Vaccinated Individuals ",
    title = "Fully Vaccinated Individuals by Education Status and Age",
    color = "Education Status"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(vars(age))
```

#### Additional/Boosted Individuals by Education Status and Age

Plot 1b shows the proportion of boosted individuals by education status (the colors), split across age. Overall we observe that in neighborhoods where there is a higher proportion of individuals with above a high school education, a higher proportion of individuals appeared to receive a booster within the first 90 days. 

``` {r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(cleaned_edu_booster_dataset) +
  aes(x = edu_prop, y = booster_prop, colour = edu) +
  geom_point(shape = "circle", size = 1) +
  scale_color_hue(direction = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Proportion of Individuals by Education Status",
    y = "Proportion of Individuals Boosted ",
    title = "Booster Individuals by Education Status and Age",
    color = "Education Status"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(vars(age))
```

Next we explored how education and vaccination status might vary across boroughs. Overall, Manhattan appears to have neighborhoods with higher proportions of college educated individuals. Neighborhoods in Staten Island and the Bronx had higher proportions of high school and some college education. 

As before, the proportion of individuals with a particular vaccine status (y-axis) is plotted against the proportion of individuals with a particular education status (x-axis) in each zip code. The color indicates the borough. 

#### Fully Vaccinated Individuals by Education Status and Boroughs

Plot 1c shows the proportion of fully vaccinated individuals by boroughs (color), spilt by their education status. While neighborhoods in all boroughs had full vaccination rates, neighborhoods where individuals who received multiple rounds of full vaccines tended to in Manhattan neighborhoods with a highly educated neighborhood composition. Communities in the Bronx and Staten Island had higher proportions of high school and some college education and seemed in the mid range for receiving full vaccinations. 

Interestingly, neighborhoods with the lowest proportion of individuals who received full vaccinations were in Brooklyn and Queens. These communities appear to contain a relatively even mix of individuals across the spectrum of education experience.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(cleaned_edu_booster_dataset) +
  aes(x = edu_prop, y = fully_vaccinated_prop, colour = borough) +
  geom_point(shape = "circle", size = 1) +
  scale_color_hue(direction = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Education Status",
    y = "Proportion of individuals fully vaccinated",
    title = "Fully vaccinated individuals by Education Status and Borough",
    color = "Boroughs"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(vars(edu))
```

#### Additional/Boosted Individuals by Education Status and Boroughs

Plot 1d shows the proportion of boosted individuals by boroughs (color), spilt by their education status. Based on these graphs, it appears that across all boroughs neighborhoods with educational attainment had a greater proportion of individuals receiving the booster. As before, Brooklyn and Queens had both the most highly boosted and least boosted neighborhoods in the city. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(cleaned_edu_booster_dataset) +
  aes(x = edu_prop, y = booster_prop, colour = borough) +
  geom_point(shape = "circle", size = 1) +
  scale_color_hue(direction = 1) +
  labs(
    x = "Education Status",
    y = "Proportion of individuals receiving boosters",
    title = "Additional/Booster individuals by Education Status and Borough",
    color = "Boroughs"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(vars(edu))

```

#### **2. Median Income**
We then used a median income dataset from the 2020 US census to understand the relationship between median income and full vaccination or booster status. In these graphs each dot represents a zip code region. The proportion of individuals with a particular vaccine status (y-axis) is plotted against the median income (x-axis). Each color indicates the borough.  

Generally, we note baseline differences in median income across boroughs with the neighborhoods in the Bronx on the lowest end of median income, and neighborhoods in Manhattan on the highest end of median income. 


```{r income_data_preprocessing, paged.print=TRUE,include=FALSE}
#Loading income data 
incomedata <- read_csv("data/median_income.csv", skip = 1)

```

```{r merege-dataset,include=FALSE}
joined_dataset_income = merge(vaccine_data,incomedata_clean, by = "modzcta", all.x = TRUE)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE, include = FALSE}

  filter(!is.na(median_nonfam)) %>% 
  select(modzcta, pop_denominator, count_partially_cumulative, count_fully_cumulative, count_1plus_cumulative, count_additional_cumulative, median_fam, median_nonfam, borough) %>% 
  mutate(Count_partially_prop = round(count_partially_cumulative/pop_denominator,2), Count_Fully_prop = round(count_fully_cumulative/pop_denominator,2), Count_1Plus_prop = round(count_1plus_cumulative/pop_denominator,2), Count_Additional_prop = round(count_additional_cumulative/pop_denominator,2), income_average = ((median_fam + median_nonfam)/2))

str(income_zip_clean)

```

#### Fully Vaccinated Individuals by Median Household Income and Boroughs

Plot 2a shows the proportion of fully vaccinated individuals by median income in each zip code region (colors represent boroughs). We observe that neighborhoods with the highest median incomes tend to have higher proportions of fully vaccinated individuals, and indeed higher proportions of individuals who received more than one round of the COVID Vaccine.

```{r,echo=FALSE}

   title = "Proportion Vaccinated & Median Household Income by Borough", 
    x = "Median Household Income", 
    y = "Proportion Vaccinated (Count_Fully_Prop)")

ggplotly(fullyinc_plotly)
```

#### Additional/Boosted Individuals by Median Household Income and Boroughs

Plot 2b shows the proportion of boosted individuals by median income in each zip code region (colors represent boroughs) after 90 days of boosters being approved for 18+. In this graph, possible associations between median income and the proportion boosted become even more pronounced; higher median income appears associated with a higher proportion of the population who received the booster. 

```{r,echo=FALSE}

boostedinc_plotly =
income_zip_clean %>%
    ggplot() +
    geom_point(aes(x = income_average, y=Count_Additional_prop, color=borough), alpha = 0.5)+

   title = "Proportion Boosted & Median Household Income by Borough", 
    x = "Median Household Income ", 
    y = "Proportion Boosted (Count_Additional_Prop)")

ggplotly(boostedinc_plotly)

```

#### **3. Poverty Level**

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("data/poverty_status.csv", skip = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()

dataset_clean = data %>% 
  mutate(modzcta = substr(geographic_area_name,6,11),

    prop_booster = count_additional_cumulative / pop_denominator
  )
```

#### Fully Vaccinated Individuals Below Poverty Level (Aged 18+)
Plot 3a: This plot shows the proportion of the population over 18 years old that is fully vaccinated by zip code in New York City on the Y axis, and proportion of the population above 18 years old that is below poverty level for whom poverty status is determined in New York City on the X axis. In general, we do not see a lot of variation. However, we do see some outliers. Some Manhattan zip codes have a higher proportion of people fully vaccinated and a lower proportion of individuals below the poverty level. Whereas some boroughs have a higher proportion of individuals under the poverty level and lower proportions of people fully vaccinated, such as in the Bronx and Brooklyn, compared to Queens and Staten Island.

```{r echo=FALSE}
joined_dataset_poverty %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = prop_below_pov_level_18_and_over, y = prop_fully, color = borough)) +
  geom_point()+
  labs(
   title = "Fully Vaccinated Individuals Below Poverty Level (Aged 18+)", 
    x = "Proportion of Individuals Below Poverty level (Aged 18+)Fully Vaccinated Individuals", 
    y = "Fully Vaccinated Individuals")

```

#### Additional/Booster Vaccinated Individuals Below Poverty Level (Aged 18+)

Plot 3b: This plot shows the proportion of the population over 18 years old that has received a booster on the Y axis, and the proportion of the population above 18 years old that is below poverty level for whom poverty status is determined on the X axis. We see much more variation with this plot. There is a lower proportion of individuals in Brooklyn and the Bronx who have received a booster, and a lower proportion of individuals in Staten Island who have received a booster, but with a lower proportion of individuals below poverty level. Additionally, several zip codes in Queens and Manhattan have a higher proportion of individuals who have received the booster.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
joined_dataset_poverty %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = prop_below_pov_level_18_and_over, y = prop_booster, color = borough)) +
  geom_point()+
  labs(
   title = "Additional/Booster Vaccinated Individuals Below Poverty Level (Aged 18+)", 
    x = "Proportion of Individuals Below Poverty Status (Aged 18+)Additional/ Boosted Indidivuals ", 
    y = "Additional/ Boosted Individuals")

```

#### Proportion of Adults Below Poverty Level by Boroughs (Aged 18+)

Plot 3c: This plot shows the proportion of the population above 18 years old that is below poverty level for whom poverty status is determined by borough zip code. The Bronx has the zipcode with the highest proportion below the poverty line, whereas Manhattan has the lowest.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
joined_dataset_poverty %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = prop_below_pov_level_18_and_over, y = borough, color = borough)) +
  geom_point()+
  labs(
   title = "Proportion of Adults Below Poverty Level by Boroughs (Aged 18+) ", 
    x = "Proportion of Individuals Below Poverty level (Aged 18+) ", 
    y = "Boroughs")

```

### **Discussion**

In this data investigation, we explored COVID vaccination and booster trends in NYC as of March 9th, 2022 (approximately 90 days after the booster was approved for all individuals aged 18 and above). We specifically explored patterns between the proportion of individuals vaccinated or boosted in NYC neighborhoods and the following demographic variables: education, median income, and poverty status.

#### **Key Findings vs. Expectations**
We anticipated observing a higher vaccination rate in more affluent boroughs such as Manhattan. We noted that Staten Island and the Bronx had the lowest vaccination completion rates among all boroughs, with more than 2 doses of the initial series seen in Manhattan. 

Manhattan, Queens, and Brooklyn had similar booster dose administration in the adult population, while the Bronx and Staten Island had lower rates of administration comparatively. 

We were surprised to find that educational attainment was not a significant influencer in obtaining booster vaccination, or completion of the full vaccination series when comparing different boroughs in NYC. 

When comparing median household income in different boroughs to proportion of fully vaccinated adult population, we did not observe variability among different boroughs. However, it was illuminating to see that there is a possible correlation between median household income and receiving booster COVID vaccinations in all boroughs. It appeared that there was a positive linear relationship between  median household income and proportion of boosted adults, with neighborhoods that had a greater median income having a greater proportion of boosted adults. When broken down by borough, however, this pattern was not observed in Staten Island or Queens. 

To look at economic background in a different lens, we compared rates of adult vaccinations compared to rate of poverty (as determined by rates below federal poverty line). Based on the previous income assessment, we hypothesized no variation between the rate of full vaccination and poverty status as all individuals were required to receive vaccinations. We were surprised to notice that there were income differences in neighborhoods with high versus low vaccination rates, with neighborhoods with lower poverty rates tended to have a higher proportion of people fully vaccinated. In particular these differences were driven by the fact that in high income neighborhoods, individuals appeared to seek multiple rounds of full vaccination, beyond the mandated single dose. 

As boosters are optional preventative care, we hypothesized that neighborhoods with higher poverty status would have lower booster rates. This expectation held true based on the data. We noticed that there was an inverse relationship between rate of poverty and completion of boosted vaccination shots across NYC. One exception was Staten Island where despite low poverty rates relative to other boroughs, booster rates were low as well. 

#### **What insights into the data did we make?**
Given our observation of the data, we were curious if education levels, access to vaccination, or socioeconomic status was influential in the lower booster rates seen in the Bronx and Staten Island.

Interestingly, regardless of the education status, booster immunization was consistently higher in Manhattan and Queens, and lower in Staten Island and the Bronx. This hints to the likelihood that educational attainment may not be a key influencer of receiving COVID booster vaccines. 

In all boroughs except for Staten Island, we noted that economic background (as portrayed by median household income and poverty rate) was not associated with completion of the original vaccine series, but related to receiving boosters among adults.

Future analyses can examine factors that may drive lower booster rates among communities. Such factors may consist of both infrastructure barriers (access to subways, pharmacies, clinics) as well as psychosocial factors (attitudes towards vaccines, health education, personal COVID history).

#### **Recommendations for further Research and Analysis of this topic.**

1. Explore how factors in race and health care access relate to vaccine and booster uptake. 

2. Identify how city infrastructure (e.g. subway access, health clinics) relates to vaccine and booster uptake.

3. Identify communities in which to focus booster efforts and novel ways to advocate for booster immunization.

4. Study appropriate differential resource allocation to boroughs with lower vaccination and booster rates (the Bronx and Staten Island). 

5. Explore other psychosocial variables (e.g. vaccine attitudes, political affiliation, health literacy) to understand differences across boroughs and neighborhoods. 

6. Investigate how vaccination trends differ among the pediatric population compared to adults.
