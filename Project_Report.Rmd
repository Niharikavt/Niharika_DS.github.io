## **Project Motivation**

Throughout the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccine availability played a significant role in reduction of new cases, while reducing symptom severity among people who were infected. With the rise of new variants, the need for booster vaccinations with new COVID strain coverage was evident. 

There were widespread reports of lack of vaccine availability in many areas, especially among those with lower socioeconomic status and limited geographic resource availability. 

Given these reports, we wanted to explore the following -

1. Factors that make neighborhoods in NYC vulnerable.
2. Trends in vaccination - how people are vaccinated - fully (FDA approved primary series) , partially( 1-dose of FDA approved primary series)  or with booster (1 complete FDA-approved primary series + additional boosters).
3. How many people are actually getting vaccinated?
COVID-19 vaccination and booster distribution by zip codes and boroughs in NYC as of 2022.
4. Disparities in vaccine distribution with respect to geographic location, poverty status, education attainment and median income.
5. Sociodemographic trends in individuals receiving complete vaccinations and boosters.

### Related Work

We were inspired by the owrk done by a previous group but they did not explore the vaccination and booster distribution blah blah blah
