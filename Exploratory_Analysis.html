<h3><strong>General Vaccine Data in NYC</strong></h3>
<p>We began with a preliminary data exploration of the proportion of
individuals who were fully vaccinated and received boosters across
different zipcodes in each borough by 3.09.22 (90 days after the booster
approval).</p>
<div id="fully-vaccinated-individuals-by-zipcode-and-boroughs"
class="section level4">
<h4>Fully Vaccinated Individuals by Zipcode and Boroughs:</h4>
<p>Fully Vaccinated: The graph below shows the proportion of people
fully vaccinated (y-axis) in each zipcode (x-axis). The colors indicate
the borough. From this graph we note a few observations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In several neighborhoods the proportion of individuals vaccinated
exceeds 1 (the blue line, which represents 100% of the population being
completely vaccinated). This indicates that within those neighborhoods
individuals received the primary vaccination series more than
once.</p></li>
<li><p>While each borough ranged in the proportion of individuals
vaccinated per neighborhood, it appears no neighborhoods in Staten
Island and the Bronx had 100% of the population vaccinated. By contrast,
in several neighborhoods across Manhattan and Brooklyn, individuals were
fully vaccinated more than once.</p></li>

<h4>Additional/Boosted Individuals by Zipcode and Boroughs:</h4>
<p>Boosted: The graph below shows the proportion of people fully boosted
(y-axis) in each zip code (x-axis) with colors indicating the borough.
This data was collected as of 3.09.22, 90 days after the booster was
approved for individuals 18+.</p>
<p>From this graph, it is interesting to note that the proportion of
individuals who received a vaccine across all boroughs ranged from
0-0.75. As before, neighborhoods in Staten Island and the Bronx had a
fewer proportion of individuals who received the booster.</p>

<h3><strong>1. Education </strong></h3>
<p>First, we used an education dataset from the 2020 US census to
understand patterns in educational attainment with full vaccination or
booster status. In these graphs each dot represents a zip code region.
The proportion of individuals with a particular vaccine status is on the
y-axis and plotted against the proportion of individuals with a
particular education status per zip code is on the x-axis.</p>

<h4>Fully Vaccinated Individuals by Education Status and Age</h4>
<p>Plot 1a below shows the proportion of fully vaccinated individuals by
education status (the colors), split across age. We observe that while
individuals across education receive full vaccinations, the communities
with higher proportions of individuals with above a high school
education tend to seek multiple rounds of full vaccinations.</p>

<h4>Additional/Boosted Individuals by Education Status and Age</h4>
<p>Plot 1b shows the proportion of boosted individuals by education
status (the colors), split across age. Overall we observe that in
neighborhoods where there is a higher proportion of individuals with
above a high school education, a higher proportion of individuals
appeared to receive a booster within the first 90 days.</p>
<p><img src="Exploratory_Analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="90%" /></p>
<p>Next we explored how education and vaccination status might vary
across boroughs. Overall, Manhattan appears to have neighborhoods with
higher proportions of college educated individuals. Neighborhoods in
Staten Island and the Bronx had higher proportions of high school and
some college education.</p>
<p>As before, the proportion of individuals with a particular vaccine
status (y-axis) is plotted against the proportion of individuals with a
particular education status (x-axis) in each zip code. The color
indicates the borough.</p>

<h4>Fully Vaccinated Individuals by Education Status and Boroughs</h4>
<p>Plot 1c shows the proportion of fully vaccinated individuals by
boroughs (color), spilt by their education status. While neighborhoods
in all boroughs had full vaccination rates, neighborhoods where
individuals who received multiple rounds of full vaccines tended to in
Manhattan neighborhoods with a highly educated neighborhood composition.
Communities in the Bronx and Staten Island had higher proportions of
high school and some college education and seemed in the mid range for
receiving full vaccinations.</p>
<p>Interestingly, neighborhoods with the lowest proportion of
individuals who received full vaccinations were in Brooklyn and Queens.
These communities appear to contain a relatively even mix of individuals
across the spectrum of education experience.</p>

<h4>Additional/Boosted Individuals by Education Status and Boroughs</h4>
<p>Plot 1d shows the proportion of boosted individuals by boroughs
(color), spilt by their education status. Based on these graphs, it
appears that across all boroughs neighborhoods with educational
attainment had a greater proportion of individuals receiving the
booster. As before, Brooklyn and Queens had both the most highly boosted
and least boosted neighborhoods in the city.</p>

<h3><strong>2. Median Income</strong></h3>
<p>We then used a median income dataset from the 2020 US census to
understand the relationship between median income and full vaccination
or booster status. In these graphs each dot represents a zip code
region. The proportion of individuals with a particular vaccine status
(y-axis) is plotted against the median income (x-axis). Each color
indicates the borough.</p>
<p>Generally, we note baseline differences in median income across
boroughs with the neighborhoods in the Bronx on the lowest end of median
income, and neighborhoods in Manhattan on the highest end of median
income.</p>
<div

<h4>Fully Vaccinated Individuals by Median Household Income and
Boroughs</h4>
<p>Plot 2a shows the proportion of fully vaccinated individuals by
median income in each zip code region (colors represent boroughs). We
observe that neighborhoods with the highest median incomes tend to have
higher proportions of fully vaccinated individuals, and indeed higher
proportions of individuals who received more than one round of the COVID
Vaccine.</p>

<p>Plot 2b shows the proportion of boosted individuals by median income
in each zip code region (colors represent boroughs) after 90 days of
boosters being approved for 18+. In this graph, possible associations
between median income and the proportion boosted become even more
pronounced; higher median income appears associated with a higher
proportion of the population who received the booster.</p>

<h4>Fully Vaccinated Individuals Below Poverty Level (Aged 18+)</h4>
<p>Plot 3a: This plot shows the proportion of the population over 18
years old that is fully vaccinated by zip code in New York City on the Y
axis, and proportion of the population above 18 years old that is below
poverty level for whom poverty status is determined in New York City on
the X axis. In general, we do not see a lot of variation. However, we do
see some outliers. Some Manhattan zip codes have a higher proportion of
people fully vaccinated and a lower proportion of individuals below the
poverty level. Whereas some boroughs have a higher proportion of
individuals under the poverty level and lower proportions of people
fully vaccinated, such as in the Bronx and Brooklyn, compared to Queens
and Staten Island.</p>

whom poverty status is determined on the X axis. We see much more
variation with this plot. There is a lower proportion of individuals in
Brooklyn and the Bronx who have received a booster, and a lower
proportion of individuals in Staten Island who have received a booster,
but with a lower proportion of individuals below poverty level.
Additionally, several zip codes in Queens and Manhattan have a higher
proportion of individuals who have received the booster.</p>
